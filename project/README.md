Vision

The project portion of cs342 extends the class exercises on a custom database for Calvin College organizations which includes membership and event planning data.  As a leader of Sexuality and Gender Awareness (SAGA) whose responsibilities include event planning and organization, a database such as this would assist with budgeting and the planning process.  This database could also be used by Building Services and Catering Services for scheduling and by other organizations within Calvin for billing and membership.

Data stored by this database is primarily information about events, people, and organizations, and data about rooms, catering plans, room arrangements, and food
types are also stored.
