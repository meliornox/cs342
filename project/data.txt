I got the data from being involved with event planning comittees over the past two years. As I didn't get a chance to go over the menus that Catering offers in detail, the data represented by the Food table is an approximation based on having ordered food form them in the past.  Rooms are a rough estimate selected from Commons and the Commons Annex. The CateringPlans, PlanFoods, and Events are hypotheticals drawn from available options. I have generated People from generatedata.com.

The nontrivial functional dependencies for my schema are:
Person ID -> firstName, lastName, status, email
Organization ID -> staffAdvisor, name, description, budget
PersonID OrganizationID -> role
Room ID-> building, num, capacity, projectorBool
Arrangement ID -> chair, shape, tablesBool
CateringPlan ID -> mealType, formality
Food ID -> foodName, foodDescription, calories, unitPrice
Event ID -> roomID, eventDate, cateringID, arrangementID, organizerID, eventName, attendance, duration
Since all nontrivial functional dependencies' left sides are candidate keys, the relation is in BCNF.

Multivalued dependencies:
planID ->> foodID
personID ->> organizationID
Since these are superkeys, the relation is in 4NF.

I chose 4NF because it is the strongest normal form. My relation was not difficult to put into 4NF with a few join tables, so I went ahead and made it as strong as I could.
